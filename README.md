# Percolation
Percolation Assignment in School
This was a school assignment titled Percolation. The idea is that there is a grid of size n*n. 
We imagine that there is water above the top row that will sink down as the squares of the grid 
open up. It percolates/percolation is met when the water above the top row makes it all the way 
down to the bottom row. Squares of the grid are randomly selected to be opened one at a time 
until the grid percolates. The PercolationStats class will run any number of attempts and give 
statistical information based on how many blocks are opened before it reaches percolation.
